(1)Print Increasing Decreasing

1. You are given a positive number n. 
2. You are required to print the counting from n to 1 and back to n again.
3. You are required to not use any loops. Complete the body of pdi function to achieve it. Don't change the signature of the function.

Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is.Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 1000

Format
Input
A number n

Output
n
n - 1
n - 2
..
1
1
2
3
..
n

Example
Sample Input

3

Sample Output
3

2
3

Solution

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // write your code here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        pdi(n);
    }

    public static void pdi(int n){
        if(n==0)
        return;
         System.out.println(n);
        pdi(n-1);
        System.out.println(n);        
    }

}



(2)Factorial
Easy

1. You are given a number n.
2. You are required to calculate the factorial of the number. Don't change the signature of factorial function.

Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is.Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.

Constraints
0 <= n <= 10

Format
Input
A number n

Output
factorial of n

Example
Sample Input

5


Sample Output
120


Solution

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // write your code here
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print(factorial(n));
    }

    public static int factorial(int n){
        if(n==0)
            return 1;
        else
            return n*factorial(n-1);
    }

}
